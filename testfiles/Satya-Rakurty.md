I have got my leave. ##**Bid me farewell, my brothers!**
-I bow to you all and take my departure.-


>Here I give back the keys of my door
....and I give up all claims to my house.
I only ask for last kind words from you.


1. We were neighbors for long,
* but I received more than I could give.
2. Now the day has dawned
* and the lamp that lit my dark corner is out.
-A summons has come and I am ready for my journey-.

-**#Rabindranath Tagore**-
