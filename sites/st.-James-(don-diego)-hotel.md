The St. James hotel, was established by Henry Lambert, former Chef to President Lincoln, and was nestled in the base of a mountain. In the town of Cimarron, just paces off the Santa Fe Trail in the northeast corner of New Mexico. The hotel is a symbol of westward expansion, Manifest Destiny, land grants, ranchers, Native Americans, Spaniards, and traditional New Mexican buildings. Originally established as a restaurant and saloon by Lambert, the building was soon transformed into a not so quaint inn, offering refuge for outlaws, Native Americans, and those travelling on the Santa Fe trail or to the west to strike wealth. A hotel guest would be welcomed by “Drinking, gambling and guns usually resulting in violence and death;” [^source1]  the hotel, restaurant and saloon truly embodies the nature of the Old Wild West portrayed in cinema and pop culture.

  text="Cimarron, divided into New Town and Old Town by the Cimarron Valleys from the Sangre de Cristo Range and is well protected from mountain gales. To the north and west rise lofty mountains, and to the sourht and east are two of the most fertile valleys in the state. In addition to the Cimarron River, the water of the Ponil and the Cimarroncito(little wild) Canyons supply adequate water for the town and the irrigation of crops. Near-by mountains provide ample fuel, timber, and game and there is good trout fishing in the surrounding streams.[^source]"
  %} 
  
Cimarron, New Mexico is a town rooted in the foothills southeast of the [Sangre De Cristo Mountain Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sangre_de_Cristo_Mountains), the town sits just northwest of fertile river valleys. Cimarron was located in the northeast sanction of New Mexico, comfortably seated on the Santa Fe Trail. The landscape surrounding the town, implied almost perfect conditions to settle or a place to stop/make camp including ample water, timber from the mountains, and abundant game and fish [^source]. Cimarron, just southwest of the [Raton Pass](https://www.santafetrailnm.org/site70.html), made for a perfectly nestled sanctuary along the Santa Fe Trail. Cimarron became an advantage along the Santa Fe Trail due to the lesser distance traveled along the [“Cimarron Cutoff,”](https://www.santafetrailnm.org/sfthistory.html) historical links say almost 75% of travelers used this pass even though the
 “Cutoff” still imposed threats from Native American violence, little to no water, firewood and grass for the animals was not readily apparent on this route [^anothersource]. The town and New Mexico as a whole were slowly being inhabited by those traveling west, the fertile plains and fortified mountains made home to gold mining, Native American strife, passing stage coaches, sheep herders and cattle drivers, all of whom were all too familiar with the ringing of a gun fired. Cimarron had such a leisurely attitude at the time, law and order was virtually non-existent, and there was not a focus on documenting the time. There is little recollection of building dates, event happenings, or a detailed understanding of the inhabitants from the 19th century, but this does not mean we can not understand the unorderly happenings of the St. James Hotel in Cimarron.  
 

#### THE BEAUBIEN-MIRANDA LAND GRANT & SON-IN-LAW LUCIEN MAXWELL 
Important though is understanding the settlement of the land, owners of that region and what they decided to do with their surpluss of power. In January of 1841 the [Beaubien-Miranda Land Grant](https://newmexicohistory.org/2015/07/21/maxwell-land-grant-an-astounding-piracy-of-the-public-domain/) was petitioned, the grant was a way in which individuals moving west, could establish a homestead,  with additional reasons such as, “to ‘afford protection from the Indians;’ the second: to ‘employ a great number of idlers;’ the third: to ‘relieve overcrowded conditions;’ the fourth: to ‘ease problems caused by a scarcity of irrigation waters,’ and the final reason was ‘to afford safe pasturage for livestock during times of war with the Navajos’”[^fourthsource]. Beaubien, a well off store keeper participating in trade[^fifthsource], and Miranda a ..... now together owned roughly 2 million acres of land. The totality of this land soon fell into the hands of [Lucien Bonaparte Maxwell](http://newmexicohistory.org/2015/07/22/lucien-maxwell/), a hunter and trapper originating from Kaskaskia, Illinois, he was in route accompanying [General Fremont](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/biographies/john-c-frémont) an expeditioner exploring and surveying for expansion, when Maxwell discovered Cimarron and the Northeast of New Mexico. [^source]. 

Upon travelling to the southwest, Maxwell decided to create a ranch in 1849, his homestead, by his friend [Kit Carson](https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/people/a_c/carson.htm) whom had arrived in 1826.[^sixthsource] Soon after Maxwell settled into town, he took hand of the daughter of one of the two wealthiest land owners, Beaubien. Her beloved name, Luz Beaubien; Maxwell bought Miranda’s half of the Beaubien-Miranda Land Grant for $2745.00  [^fourthsource] and upon Beaubien’s death in 1865 Maxwell bought the remaining heirs land for $53,000.00 [^fourthsource], becoming the wealthiest land owning individual of his time. “The Maxwell Grant as it was called, included the site of Springer, French, Maxwell, Otero, Raton, Vermejo Park, Ute Park, Elizabethtown, and in Colorado, Vigil, Stonewall, Torres, Cuarto, Tercio, Primero, Segundo”[^source]. Maxwell at this time, had a large fortune to his name, owned ample land and had begun a family. Maxwell made the decision to sell his land in 1869 to__________ and then went to retire in Fort Sumner. [^sixthsource] A piece of Maxwell's land in Cimarron, New Mexico had apparently been sold to a man named Henry Lambert in 1871; however there are blurred recollection of the actual processes that took place. Other sources stated Maxwell had decided to sell his land to a Grant, when he moved, and the grant then governed, sold, and partitioned the land... 


#### APRIL 14, 1865: RELEASING HENRY LAMBERT OF HIS DUTY

Friday, April 14, 1865 the day President Abraham Lincoln was assassinated, and within the transformation of the macro, changes rippled through the micro. Henry Lambert was relinquished of his duty to President Lincoln and General Ulysses S. Grant on that day and with a heavy, lament heart he moved southwest to find a place he'd like to settle; the northwest corner of New Mexico resembled his birthplace most. Lambert was born October 28, 1838 in France and at the ripe age of 12 was sent off to learn the skills and know how to be a cook at Havre, his journey forward took him seemingly all over the place, working on a French boat which had docked in New York in 1861 bringing him to the United States of America, working endlessly on ships, submarines, in the navy, in a circus, and for the government/president; Lambert worked anywhere from South America, Maine, New York, to Washington D.C., and Virginia. Lambert attempted roots in Virginia by opening a restaurant, but at the death of his employer, the president, and hearing of gold he moved west in attempts to strike wealth quick.[^seventhsource] Settling originally in [Elizabethtown, NM](https://www.newmexico.org/places-to-visit/ghost-towns/elizabethtown/) which is further burrowed into the mountains and just northwest of Cimarron. Lambert's original dream was golden, and when he had little luck, he resurrected a restaurant and saloon. [^eigthsource] However at some point in 1871 Lambert was tickled at the opportunity to buy from the Maxwell Land Grant; Lambert then packed his belongings and shifted just southeast to Cimarron to hopefully strike wealth in another fashion. However,
>“There is no deed showing that Lambert purchased the place in 1871. At this time trouble began brewing between the Maxwell Land Grant people and the squatters. Lucien Maxwell may have sold the property to the people concerned. In those days many deeds passed hands by a mere handshake or an old scrap of paper easily lost. With Maxwell selling to the Grant people and moving to Fort Sumner, the settlers had a thoroughly organized syndicate to deal with Holbrook may have not retained proof of his proprietorship, consequently his holdings were turned over to the sheriff for public auction”[^seventhsource].

On May 10, 1875 the piece of land was lawfully sanctioned as Lamberts for the amount of $102.[^seventhsource] Where originally stood the Lambert Inn, saloon and bar.


#### THE HOTEL & ITS GUESTS 
The Lambert Inn was remodeled, developed from its former Inn, saloon and bar, and the business was renamed as the St. James Hotel unfolded in 1882 [^seventhsource], it was located just off the main street through town, now known as Highway 21 to Rayado and the Philmont Scout Ranch, the hotel was also positioned just south of the Cimarron River. The Inn was remolded to a Hotel in the demand of more space for those travelling and taking shelter. The hotel was made of traditional stucco.....(more information about the appearance of the hotel.) The Hotels doors were open to a rainbow of people, shades of justice seekers, justice takers, thieves, Native Americans, and outlaws walked through the doors of the Inn. Offering rest either just before making it to Santa Fe or those travelling in the westward direction maybe towards California, expansion, and the dream of gold. The Hotel was famous for quenching the thirst of blood hungry ruffians along the Santa Fe Trail, the hotels walls bore witness to at least 20 murders; Fred Lambert, Henry Lamberts son had apparently recorded 26 killings at the hotel. The phrase, “Lambert had another man for breakfast,”[^source] was common for the towns people to hear. Outlaws, show makers, and those travelling west are still recognized at the hotel today and some of their spirits, such as
>“McMains, Tolby, McCollough, Whigham, Sherwin, Crockett, Dold, Moore, Wheaton, Maxwell, Abreu, Wooton, Kit Carson, Dave Crockett, Clay Allison, Mills, Hixenbaugh, Tom Boggs, Daniel Boons grandson, Rogers, Buffalo Bill, and a host of others whose names are synonymous with American Frontier history”[^seventhsource]. 

As more individuals continued to flood Cimarron and head west, the town continued to grow, the addition of, “15 saloons, 4 hotels, a post office, and a newspaper” [^source] were gradually introduced to the town. 


#### NOTEWORTHY HAPPENINGS
The hotel gave shelter and a bit more to individuals including Buffalo Bill Cody who met his beloved wife and cohost Annie Oakley, together they started a Wild West show, where they..... Then there was also the incident of room 18 where the murder of Thomas James Wright a poker champ claiming the rights to the hotel was staying. He might have won the game, but he lost his life. Room 18 is still not open to the public to this day. 


#### THE NATURAL SUCCESSION & RENOVATIONS
Henry Lambert died January 24, 1933; his wife died......[^seventhsource] Fred Lambert, son of Henry Lambert, was Cimarron’s Sherriff; Fred and brother, Gene, began a remodel of the 43 room hotel in 1901, were they discovered in the roof more than 400 bullet holes, each hole could count towards the character of the hotel and where it stood in the dynamic wild west. Remodeling the hotel happened few and far between but has seemingly removed much history that remained in its original structure, today however the visitor can still bear witness to the 22 bullet holes in the tin punched ceiling of the dining room, much of the original furniture remains, and relics of those individuals who passed through including some spirits. Though ownership of the St. James Hotel, otherwise known as Don Diego through certain points over the 19th and 20th century, has changed frequently since the mid 1900’s. The hotels ambiance of gun slinging outlaws has not been diminished, attracting visitors in its prime time, through the years, and those devilishly spirited visitors today on the hunt for ghosts and spirits. Remarked even in April of 1940 according to the Historic American Buildings Survey remarked the hotel as a stopping place along the Santa Fe trail with a famous bar, and that it had been remolded. A place to stay now for over 150 years.

#### THE HOTEL TODAY
Today an individual can stay in a modernized space in the hotel or in one of the hotels historic rooms, with some of it's original furnishings, pictures, fixtures, and belongings to visitors who have passed through. Nonetheless, a visitor can experience the fixed fashions of the old west through the hung variety of animals heads, old furniture, drab drapes, and the famous dining hall with its original bar. Remarking at the dense energy of the building, visitors can consider its past. There minds can explore the ways in which the Hotels location made for the perfect stop along the trail. One can take in the present, yet imagine themselves as a human in the past, what it would have been like to live in a beautiful mountain town, and what it woud have been like to be engulfed in anarchy, demise, and the uncivilized actions of outlaws dropping by. With bullet holes visible in the dining hall and the countless images of those who once were, one cannot help but imagine how wild the west really was.
