# Pigeons Ranch


>  “… This place was along the Old Santa Fe Trail. On it was a big adobe house about a hundred feet long with two wings of fifty or more feet, with a high adobe wall and stables in the rear. In the middle of the buildings was a patio in which there were several trees; this had a porch on three sides after the Mexican Manner. Along the front of the house was a wide porch on the road.”

The Town of Glorieta is an important town to New Mexico because it served as the battle ground for two major battles of New Mexico history. One of them being the *The Battle of Glorieta Pass*, and that same battle partially took place on *Pigeons ranch*. Pigeons Ranch is located near Glorieta, New Mexico, and was a hidden gem for travelers to take a break from traveling the Santa Fe trail during 1822, and it also served as a battle field between the Union and the Confederate troops during the Civil War in 1861. This small ranch truly is a hidden treasure of American History that should be remembered and preserved, but research and records of this historic ranch are uncommon. There is not anybody living near the ranch today because it is by a main road. It is surrounded by wildlife. A few miles out you are able to find civilization and eat wonderful New Mexican food in the town of Glorieta and look at other original buildings that also tell History. 
### Pigeons Ranch 
Pigeons Ranch, originally called “Rancho de Glorieta” is 18 miles southeast of Santa Fe, halfway through the [Glorieta Pass]( https://www.battlefields.org/learn/articles/battle-glorieta). It was owned by Alexander Pigeon, a French man, who later renamed himself to Alejandro Valle. He purchased a land grant from the Spanish for 5,275 pesos, about $257.00 today. The purchase of Spanish land is why he changed his name to Alejandro Valle. In 1851-52 and built a trading post and home on the land which still remain today. Valle “had built, the adobe ranch house after his decision to build a Santa Fe Trail-side ‘house of entertainment’ After the War with Mexico, improvement of the Santa Fe trail and increased traffic coincided with the construction of trail side complexes, ranches, farms and houses/inns such as Pigeon’s”(HSR,2). During the Days of the Santa Fe trail, the ranch also served as rest stop for travelers who were able to grab a bite to eat, rest, and feed their animals. The ranch was similar to today’s idea of a Motel. No recorded images or descriptions of the ranch before the Civil War in 1862.

### What is the Santa Fe Trail
The Santa Fe Trail is a highway, Pioneered in 1821 by [William Becknell]( https://www.britannica.com/biography/William-Becknell)  that connected Santa Fe, New Mexico to Missouri, which was about 900 miles long .The trail served as a route so traders could easily exchange goods, such as different types of tools, cloths, wool, weapons, and animals. The trail also provided a way for people to move to the west and start new lives (NPS).

### Gettysburg of the West  

During the Civil War in 1861, Confederate troops under the command of Brigadier [General Henry Sibley](https://www.battlefields.org/learn/biographies/henry-h-sibley), rallied his troops in San Antonio Texas, to move toward Denver, but to do this he had planned to march troops through New Mexico. Sibley wanted to capture gold shipments coming out of the Colorado Rockies. He also wanted to take over land to the west to gain California to access the Pacific coast. After the confederated won battles marching toward Denver they were met with very little resistance from enemies until *The Battle of Glorieta Pass*. (Feasibility Report). 

In March 1862, during The Battle of Glorieta Pass, both Confederate and Union troops used Pigeons Ranch as a hospital, Prison, and Battleground. On March 25th Confederate soldiers were captured by Union soldiers. The next day 400 Union troops used the ranch as a hospital for wounded and sick soldiers. They utilized all the supplies Valle’s Ranch had to offer such as hay. On the 27th reinforcements arrived for Union troops, and later so did reinforcements for the confederates on Pigeons Ranch. Union Soldiers used the adobe walls of the ranch as cover. The confederate troops pushed out the Union forces and took control over the ranch. Confederates, having taken over the ranch took this as a victory and left the ranch westward to Johnsons Ranch where they found their supplies and Cattle destroyed by Union troops. This left the confederates with almost nothing and they were forced back to Texas. The Battle of Glorieta pass was a major win for the Union and a turning point of the war in New Mexico Territory (Legends of America).

Because of Damage to the Ranch during the Battle of Glorieta Alejandro Valle filed a claim against the US government in 1870 for damages to his house and ranch even though he sold his ranch in 1865. In a testimony “given by Mr. Valle and one of his employees reveals losses of oxen, a horse, grain, molasses, whisky, and other supplies; and destruction of structures, equipment and family possessions.” (Feasibility Report) Despite the destruction to the ranch during the battle the US rejected his claim.

### Pigeons Ranch Today
The land has been tossed and sold to many people in hoping that they would preserve the historic sight and rebuild the structure. In December on 1992 The National Park Service signed a lease agreement with the Conservation Fund, and eventually acquired Pigeon’s Ranch. The site remains undeveloped.  The National Park Service continues to maintain structure, secure it from vandalism, and work to eliminate drainage problems caused by the flattened mounds of adobe walls.  On the land today you will find yourself surrounded by pinion bushes and juniper trees and the floor covered with shrubs and grass. You can still see the ruins of the adobe house and what remains of it. Behind the three-room adobe structure part of the original corral remains. Be careful about going into the house, as it could be dangerous because of natural deterioration of the structure. What remains today is the original structure unchanged from the days of the Civil War. You may wonder around the structure and step in the same places as Confederate and Union soldiers fought and died on, as well as the travelers and traders who stayed there while making their way on the Santa Fe Trail to make a living or start a new life. Who knows, you may be stepping in the same footsteps as an ancestor.
