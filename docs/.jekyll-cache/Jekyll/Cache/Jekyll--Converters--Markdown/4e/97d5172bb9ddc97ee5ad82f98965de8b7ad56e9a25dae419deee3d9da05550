<p>Beginning at a trading post in 1847, Council Grove, situated an hour southwest of Topeka, Kansas on the Neosho River, played an important role along the Santa Fe Trail as the last stop heading west until Santa Fe. <sup id="fnref:Andreas"><a href="#fn:Andreas" class="footnote">1</a></sup> It has served traders, merchants, and ranchers throughout the mid and late 1800s and into the twentieth century. When the Santa Fe Trail opened up in 1821, Council Grove was just an area with plenty of grazing land, water, trees, and safe crossing. <sup id="fnref:NRHP-Brigham"><a href="#fn:NRHP-Brigham" class="footnote">2</a></sup> By 1854 with the opening of Kansas to white settlers, Council Grove changed from a simple trading post to the true jumping off point for the Santa Fe Trail. <sup id="fnref:Brigham-Andreas"><a href="#fn:Brigham-Andreas" class="footnote">3</a></sup> As time went on, Council Grove continued to expand and adapt based on the changing needs of those on the trail, like the adoption of railroads and the subsequent trade of cattle. <sup id="fnref:Maloy"><a href="#fn:Maloy" class="footnote">4</a></sup></p>

<p>Council Grove began as little more than a resting point on the newly opened Santa Fe Trail in 1821. <sup id="fnref:NRHP8441"><a href="#fn:NRHP8441" class="footnote">5</a></sup> The area boasted plenty of water, grazing land, trees, and safety. <sup id="fnref:NRHP8442"><a href="#fn:NRHP8442" class="footnote">6</a></sup> While still organized as an Indian territory, <a href="https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/seth-millington-hays/17339">Seth Hays</a>, a business man and the first white settler in Council Grove,  opened the first trading post under government contract in 1847. <sup id="fnref:Maloy2"><a href="#fn:Maloy2" class="footnote">7</a></sup> By 1854 Seth Hays had competition from the Withington brothers, the Choteau brothers, and others. <sup id="fnref:Brigham-Maloy"><a href="#fn:Brigham-Maloy" class="footnote">8</a></sup> Seth Hays built the first house in Council Grove in 1857. <sup id="fnref:Brigham12"><a href="#fn:Brigham12" class="footnote">9</a></sup> With more people realizing the potential for business as the last stop heading west on the Santa Fe Trail, Tom Hill constructed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Chance_Store">Last Chance Store</a>, also built in 1857. <sup id="fnref:Brigham15"><a href="#fn:Brigham15" class="footnote">10</a></sup> This store provided the last stop along the Santa Fe Trail for hundreds of miles. With the organization of Kansas in 1854, towns could begin incorporating, as Council Grove did in 1858 with Seth Hays and other business people forming the town company in 1857. <sup id="fnref:Brigham1116"><a href="#fn:Brigham1116" class="footnote">11</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="railroad-or-bust">Railroad or Bust</h2>
<p>With the advent of the railroad, Council Grove looked to cash in on the extra potential for transportation and movement, just as they were accustomed to with the Santa Fe Trail passing through the town. In 1865, the town passed a bond measure for $100,000 for railroads to be brought through, but these bonds failed to attract railroads. <sup id="fnref:Maloy50"><a href="#fn:Maloy50" class="footnote">12</a></sup> The town had to wait four more years for a railroad, when in 1869 the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri%E2%80%93Kansas%E2%80%93Texas_Railroad">M. K. &amp; T. Railroad</a> made its first passage through the town. <sup id="fnref:Brigham40"><a href="#fn:Brigham40" class="footnote">13</a></sup> In 1881, more bonds passed to bring the Topeka, Salina and Southwestern Railroad which became part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missouri_Pacific_Railroad">Missouri Pacific Railroad</a> line. <sup id="fnref:Brigham62"><a href="#fn:Brigham62" class="footnote">14</a></sup> These railroad lines allowed businesses to connect with more people and keep the town as an important stop along the Santa Fe Trail.</p>

<h2 id="twentieth-century-to-post-war-era">Twentieth Century to Post War Era</h2>
<p>Looking to connect more farmers, ranchers, and businesses to more people, Council Grove began to develop a road system for automobiles in the early 20th century. In 1901, W.E. Dennison rode around town on his new automobile. <sup id="fnref:NRHP8501"><a href="#fn:NRHP8501" class="footnote">15</a></sup> By 1913 there were over 200 automobiles in Council Grove and by 1921 there were 47 miles of hard surface roads to be built in the town. <sup id="fnref:NRHP850-Brigham98"><a href="#fn:NRHP850-Brigham98" class="footnote">16</a></sup> While Kansas began implementing plans on a unified road network, Council Grove was able to bring three highways through the town by 1932. <sup id="fnref:KDOT"><a href="#fn:KDOT" class="footnote">17</a></sup></p>

<p>The 1920s-30s proved to be a difficult time for Council Grove. In the early part of the 1920s, farmers were going into debt due to inflated crop pricing. <sup id="fnref:NRHP8521"><a href="#fn:NRHP8521" class="footnote">18</a></sup> However, with large federal investment in the 1930s, Council Grove was able to overcome difficulties and create a safer and modern town. To help with flooding, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration">WPA</a> approved $40 million in 1934 to help prevent flooding with the project being completed in 1942. <sup id="fnref:NRHP8522"><a href="#fn:NRHP8522" class="footnote">19</a></sup> The town received other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Deal">New Deal</a> era help from the federal government including a new jail, a post office, a water plant, and the Flint Hills Rural Electrification Administration. <sup id="fnref:NRHP8553"><a href="#fn:NRHP8553" class="footnote">20</a></sup></p>

<p>After World War II, the Kansas State Legislature approved money to buy the <a href="https://www.kshs.org/index.php?url=kaw_mission">Kaw Indian Mission</a> to create a museum. <sup id="fnref:NRHP8531"><a href="#fn:NRHP8531" class="footnote">21</a></sup> While Council Grove had experienced many floods before, the 1951 flood was unlike any other. With the Neosho Rover flowing at 121,000 cubic feet/second, many buildings downtown were damaged. <sup id="fnref:Juracek4"><a href="#fn:Juracek4" class="footnote">22</a></sup> Included in this damage was the Kaw Indian Mission which meant that the museum wouldn‚Äôt open for another year. <sup id="fnref:NRHP8532"><a href="#fn:NRHP8532" class="footnote">23</a></sup> This new museum and later on a new reservoir meant that Council Grove quickly began focusing on tourism, bringing several thousand people a year to the museum and several hundred thousand to the Council Grove reservoir. <sup id="fnref:NRHP8533"><a href="#fn:NRHP8533" class="footnote">24</a></sup></p>
